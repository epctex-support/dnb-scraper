### DnB Scraper input example

```json
{
    "mode": "COMPANIES",
    "search": "apple",
    "maxItems": 5
}
```

## During the run

During the run, the actor will output messages letting you know what's going on and which page it's currently scraping.

When items are loaded from the page, you should see a message about this event with a loaded item count.

If you provide incorrect input to the actor, it will immediately stop with a failure state and output an explanation of what went wrong.

## DnB Scraper export

During the run, the actor stores results into an Apify dataset. Each item is a separate item in the dataset.

You can manage the results in any language (Python, PHP, Node.js/NPM). See the FAQ or <a href="https://www.apify.com/docs/api" target="blank">our API reference</a> to learn more about getting results from this Dun & Bradstreet actor.

### Scraped DnB industry result

The structure of each industry scraped from DnB looks like this:

```json
{
    "SIC Codes": "7359",
    "NAICS Codes": "532420",
    "Related Industries": [
        "Computer Networking Equipment Manufacturing",
        "Commercial & Industrial Equipment Rental & Leasing",
        "Computer & Office Equipment Wholesalers",
        "Computer Manufacturing",
        "Rental & Leasing"
    ],
    "Description": "Companies in this industry lease technology and office equipment for use in business operations. Major companies include CSI Leasing, Electro Rent, Marlin Business Services, and SmartSource Rentals (all based in the US), along with Fuyo General Lease (Japan) and Syscap (the UK). Major manufacturers such as Hewlett Packard, Canon, and Xerox also offer technology leasing services.",
    "Competitive Landscape": "Demand is driven by business activity, especially in industries that rely heavily on technology. The profitability of individual companies depends on the merchandising mix and the cost of financing rental inventory. Large companies have economies of scale in buying equipment and having multiple outlets to lease the equipment. Smaller companies can compete by providing specialty products for local markets and superior customer service. The US industry is concentrated: the top 50 companies account for about 85% of revenue.",
    "Products, Operations & Technology": "Leasing of computers and peripheral equipment accounts for about 50% of industry revenue; leasing of office machinery, furniture, and fixtures accounts for about 30%."
}
